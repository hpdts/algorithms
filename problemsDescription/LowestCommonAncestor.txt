Let T be a tree with n positions. Define the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
between two positions p and q as the lowest position in T that has both p and q
as descendants (where we allow a position to be a descendant of itself ). Given
two positions p and q, describe an efficient algorithm for finding the LCA of p
and q. What is the running time of your algorithm?
